Several cases have been described in animals, but in plants we lack well-documented cases of replicated radiation that combine comprehensive phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses, the delimitation of geographic areas within which a set of ‘ecomorphs’ evolved independently and the identification of potential underlying mechanisms. Here we document the repeated evolution of a set of leaf ecomorphs in a group of neotropical plants. The Oreinotinus lineage within the angiosperm clade Viburnum spread from Mexico to Argentina through disjunct cloud forest environments. In 9 of 11 areas of endemism, species with similar sets of leaf forms evolved in parallel. We reject gene-flow-mediated evolution of similar leaves and show, instead, that species with disparate leaf forms differ in their climatic niches, supporting ecological adaptation as the driver of parallelism. Our identification of a case of replicated radiation in plants sets the stage for comparative analyses of such phenomena across the tree of life.},

Two main structural groups of norditerpene alkaloids, the N-(methylsuccinimido) anthranoyllycoctonine type (MSAL-type) and the non-MSAL type, are responsible for larkspur-induced poisoning. Information on the alkaloid composition is lacking for a number of Delphinium species, including D. ramosum. Delphinium ramosum grows throughout parts of Colorado and northern New Mexico. The objective of this study was to profile the alkaloid composition of D. ramosum throughout its geographical distribution using both field and herbarium specimens. Two alkaloid profiles were identified, one that contained significantly greater concentrations of the MSAL-type alkaloids than the other. Plants containing each respective alkaloid profile were unique in their geographical distribution. Populations of these two chemotypes will likely differ in their toxic potential and consequently pose different risks of poisoning when grazed by livestock species. This information has important implications in grazing management decisions on D. ramosum-infested rangelands and demonstrates that botanical classification alone is not an adequate indicator of relative risk of toxicity.},

The choice of groups to be recognized is based on the present author’s opinion that rapid evolution of Delphinium taxa occurred in the Willamette Valley following habitat disturbance caused by catastrophic flooding from the late-glacial-age Spokane Floods. Delphinium pavonaceum Ewan, D. leucophaeum Greene, and D. oreganum Howell, which are endemic to the Willamette Valley, may have evolved in the ca. 12,000 years since the floods occurred. These 3 groups are here given species rank, unlike their treatment in Flora of North America. This is in line with how the taxa are viewed by Oregon botanists concerned with the rare and endangered species of the state. Lectotypification is necessary for D. pavonaceum. A further taxonomic change is the reduction of D. basalticum M.J. Warnock to synonymy under D. glareosum Greene.},

	abstract = {One enduring question in evolutionary biology is the extent of archaic admixture in the genomes of present-day populations. In this paper, we present a test for ancient admixture that exploits the asymmetry in the frequencies of the two nonconcordant gene trees in a three-population tree. This test was first applied to detect interbreeding between Neandertals and modern humans. We derive the analytic expectation of a test statistic, called the D statistic, which is sensitive to asymmetry under alternative demographic scenarios. We show that the D statistic is insensitive to some demographic assumptions such as ancestral population sizes and requires only the assumption that the ancestral populations were randomly mating. An important aspect of D statistics is that they can be used to detect archaic admixture even when no archaic sample is available. We explore the effect of sequencing error on the false-positive rate of the test for admixture, and we show how to estimate the proportion of archaic ancestry in the genomes of present-day populations. We also investigate a model of subdivision in ancestral populations that can result in D statistics that indicate recent admixture.},

However, it remains unknown how increasing aridity and livestock grazing pressure—two major drivers of global change4–6—shape the trait covariation that underlies plant phenotypic diversity1,7. Here we assessed how covariation among 20 chemical and morphological traits responds to aridity and grazing pressure within global drylands. Our analysis involved 133,769 trait measurements spanning 1,347 observations of 301 perennial plant species surveyed across 326 plots from 6 continents. Crossing an aridity threshold of approximately 0.7 (close to the transition between semi-arid and arid zones) led to an unexpected 88\% increase in trait diversity. This threshold appeared in the presence of grazers, and moved toward lower aridity levels with increasing grazing pressure. Moreover, 57\% of observed trait diversity occurred only in the most arid and grazed drylands, highlighting the phenotypic uniqueness of these extreme environments. Our work indicates that drylands act as a global reservoir of plant phenotypic diversity and challenge the pervasive view that harsh environmental conditions reduce plant trait diversity8–10. They also highlight that many alternative strategies may enable plants to cope with increases in environmental stress induced by climate change and land-use intensification.},

Maximum likelihood analyses of 2088 aligned nucleotides of plastid and nuclear sequences obtained from up to 185 species of Delphinieae from throughout the geographic range (plus relevant outgroups) show that three short-lived (facultative annual or biennial) Mediterranean species belonging to Delphinium subgenus Staphisagria are the sister clade to all other Delphinieae, implying that Staphisagria needs to be raised to genus status if Delphinium and Aconitum are to become mutually monophyletic. Molecular clock dating suggests an origin of the sampled Delphinieae in the Early Oligocene (c. 32.3 Ma) and expansion to North America of Aconitum and Delphinium around 3.3 and 2.9 Ma ago, respectively; the East African Mts. were reached by long-distance dispersal some 2.4 Ma ago, coincident with the major uplift of the East African Rift system. The ancestral growth form of the Delphinieae could not be reconstructed, but Late Miocene bursts in diversification rates in the Himalayan and southwestern Chinese clades of Aconitum and Delphinium appear to be associated with transitions from short-lived to long-lived life histories.},

	abstract = {For nearly two decades, the American Southwest has been in the grips of a long-term ‘megadrought’, punctuated by a number of short and severe ‘global change type droughts’ (i.e., negative precipitation anomalies co-occurring with high temperature). These events have caused widespread mortality of the drought-sensitive piñon pine (Pinus edulis) while co-dominant Juniperus spp. have historically been much more drought tolerant and thus have rarely died. However, a severe drought occurred in 2018 that rapidly ({\textless}1 year) caused canopy dieback of Juniperus osteosperma across a vast area of southeastern Utah. In order to uncover the etiology behind this surprising dieback event, we set up a series of survey plots that captured gradients in microclimate, topography, and dieback severity. We also quantified xylem hydraulic damage and assessed the presence of various biotic agents in declining junipers to identify the primary causes of this dieback. We observed that juniper canopy dieback was most severe ({\textgreater}60\% canopy dieback) at hot, dry, low elevation sites, and was associated with drought-induced hydraulic damage. There was no evidence that biotic agents could be the primary drivers of this dieback, implicating the acute effects of drought as the main causal agent. The speed and scale of this drought-induced juniper dieback seems to be historically unprecedented in the region and foreshadows an uncertain future for piñon-juniper woodlands as the region continues to get warmer and drier.},

Delphinium gypsophilum has been proposed to be a hybrid derivative of D. recurvatum and D. hesperium ssp. pallescens; D. luteum is of putative hybrid origin between D. decorum and D. nudicaule. The nuclear and chloroplast sequence data were analyzed separately and, because there was no conflict, in combination. TrnL-F alone did not provide much resolution. The ITS data set and the combined ITS/trnL-F data set resolved several small clades. Delphinium luteum appears in a clade with both of its putative parents, and D. gypsophilum appears in a clade with D. recurvatum. In both cases, the sequence data are consistent with hybrid origin, but are also consistent with the putative hybrids being closely related to one or both of their proposed progenitors. Population-level data (allozymes, RAPDs, and AFLPs) support the latter hypothesis. Although our goal was not to resolve all relationships throughout sect.

	abstract = {Climate change presents distinct ecological and physiological challenges to plants as extreme climate events become more common. Understanding how species have adapted to drought, especially ecologically important nonmodel organisms, will be crucial to elucidate potential biological pathways for drought adaptation and inform conservation strategies. To aid in genome-to-phenome research, a draft genome was assembled for a diploid individual of Artemisia tridentata subsp. tridentata, a threatened keystone shrub in western North America. While this taxon has few genetic resources available and genetic/genomics work has proven difficult due to genetic heterozygosity in the past, a draft genome was successfully assembled. Aquaporin (AQP) genes and their promoter sequences were mined from the draft genome to predict mechanisms regulating gene expression and generate hypotheses on key genes underpinning drought response. Fifty-one AQP genes were fully assembled within the draft genome. Promoter and phylogenetic analyses revealed putative duplicates of A. tridentata subsp. tridentata AQPs which have experienced differentiation in promoter elements, potentially supporting novel biological pathways. Comparison with nondrought-tolerant congener supports enrichments of AQP genes in this taxon during adaptation to drought stress. Differentiation of promoter elements revealed that paralogues of some genes have evolved to function in different pathways, highlighting these genes as potential candidates for future research and providing critical hypotheses for future genome-to-phenome work.},

	abstract = {The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via “SNP chip” microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

	abstract = {Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled whole genome re-sequencing in many species providing unprecedented discovery and characterization of molecular polymorphisms. There are limitations, however, to next-generation sequencing approaches for species with large complex genomes such as barley and wheat. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) has been developed as a tool for association studies and genomics-assisted breeding in a range of species including those with complex genomes. GBS uses restriction enzymes for targeted complexity reduction followed by multiplex sequencing to produce high-quality polymorphism data at a relatively low per sample cost. Here we present a GBS approach for species that currently lack a reference genome sequence. We developed a novel two-enzyme GBS protocol and genotyped bi-parental barley and wheat populations to develop a genetically anchored reference map of identified SNPs and tags. We were able to map over 34,000 SNPs and 240,000 tags onto the Oregon Wolfe Barley reference map, and 20,000 SNPs and 367,000 tags on the Synthetic W9784×Opata85 (SynOpDH) wheat reference map. To further evaluate GBS in wheat, we also constructed a de novo genetic map using only SNP markers from the GBS data. The GBS approach presented here provides a powerful method of developing high-density markers in species without a sequenced genome while providing valuable tools for anchoring and ordering physical maps and whole-genome shotgun sequence. Development of the sequenced reference genome(s) will in turn increase the utility of GBS data enabling physical mapping of genes and haplotype imputation of missing data. Finally, as a result of low per-sample costs, GBS will have broad application in genomics-assisted plant breeding programs.},

	abstract = {The complex zygomorphic flowers of the early-diverging eudicot Delphinium provide an opportunity to explore intriguing evolutionary, developmental, and genetic questions. The dorsal perianth organs, consisting of a spurred sepal and the nectar-bearing spurred petal(s) in Delphinium, contribute to the dorso-ventralization and zygomorphic flower morphology. The seamless integration of the two or three dorsal petaloid spurred organs is considered a synorganization, and the resulting organ complex is referred to as a hyperorgan. The hyperorgan shows variability within the tribe due to variation in the number, size, and shape of the spurs. Research in recent decades within this tribe has enhanced our understanding of morphological evolution of flowers. More recently, functional studies using the RNAi approach of Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) have unraveled interesting results highlighting the role of gene duplication in the functional diversification of organ identity and symmetry genes. Research in this early-diverging eudicot genus bridges the gaps in understanding the morphological innovations that are mostly studied in model grass and core eudicot clades. This first comprehensive review synthesizes eco-evo-devo research on Delphinium, developing a holistic understanding of recent advancements and establishing the genus as an exceptional model for addressing fundamental questions in developmental genetics, particularly in the evolution of complex flowers. This progress highlights Delphinium’s significant potential for future studies in this field.},

	abstract = {Natural selection is an important driver of genetic and phenotypic differentiation between species. For species in which potential gene flow is high but realized gene flow is low, adaptation via natural selection may be a particularly important force maintaining species. For a recent radiation of New World desert shrubs (Encelia: Asteraceae), we use fine-scale geographic sampling and population genomics to determine patterns of gene flow across two hybrid zones formed between two independent pairs of species with parapatric distributions. After finding evidence for extremely strong selection at both hybrid zones, we use a combination of field experiments, high-resolution imaging, and physiological measurements to determine the ecological basis for selection at one of the hybrid zones. Our results identify multiple ecological mechanisms of selection (drought, salinity, herbivory, and burial) that together are sufficient to maintain species boundaries despite high rates of hybridization. Given that multiple pairs of Encelia species hybridize at ecologically divergent parapatric boundaries, such mechanisms may maintain species boundaries throughout Encelia.},
